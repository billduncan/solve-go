## Description:
- solve a given (stdin) sudoku puzzle if possible
- uses a depth first, backtracking algorithm
- uses bitmap arrays for fast lookup
- input from stdin, space delimited cells of puzzle
- zero used for blanks
- hash mark and empty lines are ignored
- very little error checking!

## Note:
- VERY new to programming in go (a few days), so, be kind!
